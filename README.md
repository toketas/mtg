## Some notes:

Check your code first:
- `git diff` tells which lines of code you've changed

If you have new files, add them
`$ git add ../app/example.jsx`

1. And then commit:

```
  $ git commit -m <your commit message here>
  $ git push
```

2. Another way to do:
  - Use `git commit -a` parameter `-a` means add every change
  - Write your <message> in the text editor, save and close
  - `git push`
